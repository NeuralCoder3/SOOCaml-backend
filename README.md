# Backend

This folder contains the source code and configuration to run the backend.

## Prerequisites

The dependencies of this package must be installed to be run.
```bash
npm install
```

Just start it via:
```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a server listening on port 8000, serving `code/examples` as examples and `code/shares` the folder the files are shared to.
